# Plan

## Base requirements

- Retrieve task responses from the Scale API
- Download the original images used in the tasks
- Perform a quality check on the task responses
- Output the results of the quality check in a clear and consistent format

# Extra mile (based on available time)

- The output could be a html file with the results
- Design and implement a modular, extensible CLI capable of adding scripts in the future
- Ensure the CLI supports seamless input/output piping for efficient data processing and chaining
- Perform the download and verification of the images in batches with a stack approach
- Save snapshots to avoid downloading and verifying if the process is interrupted

# Tentative steps

- First implement the most basic way possible, to avoid wasting time on unnecessary complexity
- HTML output
- Start clean and refactor
- Correct error handling
- Write the README
- NTH: Stdin/stdout support
- NTH: Batch processing with a stack approach
- NTH: Complete CLI implementation
- NTH: Unit tests
- NTH: Add the snapshot feature to resume from the last processed task
